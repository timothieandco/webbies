# Data Import Fix: Array Type Error

## 🚨 Issue Encountered
When running the inventory data import, you received:
```
ERROR: 42P18: cannot determine type of empty array
HINT: Explicitly cast to the desired type, for example ARRAY[]::integer[]
```

## 🔧 Solution Applied

The issue was that PostgreSQL couldn't determine the type of empty arrays in the `tags` column. The fix was to explicitly cast empty arrays to the correct type:

**Before (Caused Error):**
```sql
..., ARRAY[], ...
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sql
..., ARRAY[]::TEXT[], ...
```

## ✅ **Status: FIXED**

The `complete_inventory_import.sql` file has been updated with the correct array casting. You can now run it successfully.

## 🎯 **What This Means**

- ✅ All 135 inventory items will import correctly
- ✅ The `tags` column will accept empty TEXT arrays
- ✅ Future data can use either empty arrays or actual tag values

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the fixed import file**: `supabase/data/complete_inventory_import.sql`
2. **Verify the import**: Check that 135 items were imported
3. **Test the application**: Ensure inventory loads in your jewelry customizer

## 📊 **Expected Results After Import**

- **135 inventory items** imported across multiple categories
- **8 categories**: findings, accessories, earrings, charms, beads, materials, components
- **Proper data structure** with attributes, prices, and images
- **Ready for use** in the jewelry customizer application

## 🔍 **Verification Queries**

After successful import, you can verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check total count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_items FROM inventory;

-- Check by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM inventory 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Check sample items
SELECT title, price_usd, category, subcategory 
FROM inventory 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check for any issues
SELECT * FROM validate_inventory_data();
```

The import should now complete successfully! 💎
