### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- supabase/migrations/20250802000006_improved_categorization.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Results
```sql
-- Check category distribution:
SELECT * FROM category_summary;

-- Verify all items are categorized:
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_items,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN category IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as categorized_items
FROM inventory;
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Your code changes are already applied, just restart to see the results
npm run dev
```

## üéâ **Expected Results After Migration**

- Categories will align with your business model
- Easy to query and filter inventory

**In Your Application:**
- Categories will show actual counts like "Necklaces (18)", "Charms (35)"

### Application Verification  
- [ ] Category buttons show actual item counts
- [ ] Filtering by category works correctly
- [ ] Search finds items across all categories
- [ ] Inventory status shows "Live Inventory (135 items)"

### Sample Verification Queries
```sql
-- Should return 7 categories with proper counts
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM inventory GROUP BY category;

-- Should show 135 total items, 135 categorized
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN category IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as categorized
FROM inventory;

-- Sample items from each category
SELECT category, title FROM inventory 
WHERE category IN ('necklaces', 'bracelets', 'charms', 'keychains') 
GROUP BY category, title 
ORDER BY category;
```
